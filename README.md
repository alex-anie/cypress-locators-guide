## `cypress open`

You can open Cypress from your **project root** using the commands, depending on the package manager. In this case, we are using `npm`. You can learn more about another package manager [here](https://docs.cypress.io/app/get-started/open-the-app#cypress-open)

```bash
npx cypress open
```

After a moment, the Cypress Launchpad will open.

## `lambdaTest Run`

You can run cypress via Lambdatest web automation via npm. Learn how to setup lambdaTest and Cypress [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-cypress-testing/#/prerequisites)

```bash
lambdatest-cypress run
```

This will run Cypress on LambdaTest Web Automation.
